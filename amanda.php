	<h2>School Life</h2>

	<p>I am a student here at University of Rochester finishing up my major in Brain & Cognitive Sciences 
	as well as minors in Computer Science and Psychology. I knew coming into college that I wanted to major in Brain & Cognitive Sciences because it seemed like a combination of biology and psychology—two subjects I had loved in high school. 
	I had originally planned on double majoring in psychology along with my Brain & Cognitive Sciences major, 
	but when I took The Science of Programming (CSC 171) as part of my Brain & Cognitive Sciences program I loved it and decided to stick with it. 
	I’m very glad I took that class early on in my college career so that I was able to add a Computer Science minor and explore that newfound interest. 
	I’ve taken a large variety of different classes here at University of Rochester, and some of them were easier than others. 
	In the following paragraph I will describe some of the classes that were the most difficult for me. Artificial Intelligence was one of the most difficult classes I’ve taken at U of R, 
	because there was a lot of dense material on the exams. Basic Neurobiology was also a very difficult class because of the large amount of dense material on the exams. 
	For each of these two classes there were 4 units, and I think each unit could have been a class all its own.</p>

	<h2>Work Life</h2>

	<p>I’ve held a number of different jobs since beginning my college career. 
	My first research job was with the Approach-Avoidance Motivation Research Group.
	My first summer job was working as a summer camp counselor at Mount Hope Christian School. 
	Then I worked as a teaching assistant for BIO 110, and then I worked as a teaching assistant for PSY 161.
	Then I worked for a year at the Kid Neurolab, helping conduct fMRI research on children’s mathematical abilities. 
	Then I worked at Yale’s Computation and Cognitive Development lab for a summer. 
	This year, I’ve been working as a Peer Advisor for the Brain & Cognitive Sciences department, 
	as well as a Teaching Assistant for Machines & Consciousness.</p>

	<h2>Free time Life</h2>

	<p>In addition to my academic and curricular pursuits, I have a number of hobbies. 
	I really enjoy dancing, and to keep up with this interest I have completed a Dance cluster as well as been a member of
	Ballet Performance Group. This semester, I hope to join Rochester Rangoli to learn a bit of Bollywood dance
	I also really enjoy making different types of crafts, although I’ve had less time to pursue this activity as a college student.
	One of my favorite types of crafts is jewelry-making. In fact, I got my ears pierced in high school to justify keeping 
	the pairs of earrings I had made and really liked. I also enjoy playing games, particularly hidden identity games. 
	Some of my recent favorites have been Avalon and Tempel des Schreckens. I also enjoy playing my clarinet, 
	indoor ice skating, and playing video games. </p>
