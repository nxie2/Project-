	<h2>School Life</h2>

	<p>My original plan was to double major in Psychology and International Relation, so I took many of these major coursesduring 
		my freshman year. However, after a year, I came to realize that International Relation is not something
		that I am truly interested in. Then, I started looking into other majors, and eventually picked Digital Media Studies
		because it covers many different fields and is related to communication, which I am considering as my job path in the
		future. Although there are many major classes I need to take, I am still trying to maximize what I can learn in college;
		I took a variety of courses such as dance, stage design, French, python, etc.</p>

	<h2>Work Life</h2>

	<p>Due to a special internship program in my high school, I’ve interned at two different companies during my high school time
		—- South China Morning Post and VMware. However, since I was still young and did not to too much in either of the field,
		my internship wasn’t as meaningful as my other experience later in college. Freshman year summer in college,
		I worked as an HR intern in IKEA, and I have loved the time working with the company and the co-workers.
		I like the working environment/company’s culture of IKEA; how everyone treated me like an actual employee to ask me
		do things; and how much I learned about work, new skills, and even new people that summer.</p>

	<h2>Free time Life</h2>

	<p>During my spare time, I like to watch movies, listen to music, hangout with friends, travel,read,and any outdoor activitiess.
		I am not the kind of person that can be in one space for a long time. I have travelled to around 15 countries so far.
		I like to go out, to explore, and to try new things. Therefore, there is not a certain kind of music of movies that
		I call as favorite; I am always open to new things and new challenges.</p>
