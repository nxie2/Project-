                    in Computer Science and Psychology. I knew coming into college that I wanted to major in Brain & Cognitive Sciences
                    because it seemed like a combination of biology and psychology—two subjects I had loved in high school.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Hi everyone! My Chinese name is Yiqun Ding but I go by Juliet. I am from Shanghai, China; however, this is already my sixth
                    year in States. I went to a private high school called Salem Academy in North Carolina. The school was in a really
                    small city called Winston-Salem, where Wake Forest University is, so I decided to go to a larger city where there are
                    more resources and I can do more things. I am currently a sophomore at University of Rochester. I am trying to double
                    major in Digital Media Studies and Psychology.</p>

                <p class="card-text">I am originally from Louisiana, but I moved around the state a lot. At the beginning of sophomore year of high school,
                    I left my home to attend a public, boarding school in rural, northern Louisiana. Three years later, I was faced with the decision to stay or leave Louisiana. In the end, I decided that there weren’t many opportunities for me in Louisiana, and I eventually learned of the UofR.
                    This campus offered me a different perspective on cultural, social, and political issues, which trully interested me.
                    And here I am.</p>
