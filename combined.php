                        my freshman year. However, after a year, I came to realize that International Relation is not something
                        that I am truly interested in. Then, I started looking into other majors, and eventually picked Digital Media Studies
                        because it covers many different fields and is related to communication, which I am considering as my job path in the
                        future. Although there are many major classes I need to take, I am still trying to maximize what I can learn in college;
                        I took a variety of courses such as dance, stage design, French, python, etc.</p>

                    I am very interested in how the world works, and I find both theoretical research and its application interesting.
                    However, I decided to major in Mechanical Engineering because the idea of building something that could impact
                    others interests me, which is why I also decided to minor in computer science. So far at UofR,
                    I have taken the following courses: CSC 170, CSC 171, CSC 172, CSC 214, and CSC 240. Additionally,
                    I have been a CHM 132 Lab Teacher Assistant, and I am currently a CSC 240/440 TA.</p>

                    I knew coming into college that I wanted to major in Brain & Cognitive Sciences because it seemed like a combination of biology and psychology—two subjects I had loved in high school.
                    I had originally planned on double majoring in  psychology  along with my Brain & Cognitive Sciences major,
                    but when I took The Science of Programming (CSC 171) as part of my Brain & Cognitive Sciences program I loved it and decided to stick with it.
                    In the following paragraph I will describe some of the classes that were the most difficult for me. Artificial Intelligence was one of the most difficult classes I’ve taken at U of R,
                    because there was a lot of dense material on the exams. Basic Neurobiology was also a very difficult class because of the large amount of dense material on the exams.
