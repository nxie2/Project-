	<h2>Amanda O'Donnell</h2>
	
	<p>I am a student here at University of Rochester finishing up my major in Brain & Cognitive Sciences as well as minors 
		in Computer Science and Psychology. I knew coming into college that I wanted to major in Brain & Cognitive Sciences 
		because it seemed like a combination of biology and psychology—two subjects I had loved in high school.</p>

	<h2>Yiqun Ding</h2>

	<p>Hi everyone! My Chinese name is Yiqun Ding but I go by Juliet. I am from Shanghai, China; however, this is already my sixth
		year in States. I went to a private high school called Salem Academy in North Carolina. The school was in a really 
		small city called Winston-Salem, where Wake Forest University is, so I decided to go to a larger city where there are 
		more resources and I can do more things. I am currently a sophomore at University of Rochester. I am trying to double
		major in Digital Media Studies and Psychology.</p>

	<h2>Jack Dalton</h2>

	<p>I am originally from Louisiana, but I moved around the state a lot. At the beginning of sophomore year of high school,
		I left my home to attend a public, boarding school in rural, northern Louisiana. My high school was very different
		from others in that its focus was academics and maintaining a positive public image (it was basically UofR).
		Therefore, while I volunteered a lot and did various other community service events, I was learning a lot about 
		what I wanted to do. It was there, where I learned about careers in the sciences and began to think about what
		I wanted to do with my life. Three years later, I was faced with the decision to stay or leave Louisiana. 
		In the end, I decided that there weren’t many opportunities for me in Louisiana, and I eventually learned of the UofR. 
		This campus offered me a different perspective on cultural, social, and political issues, which trully interested me.
		And here I am.</p>
