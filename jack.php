	<h2>School Life</h2>

	<p>I am a Mechanical Engineering major at the University of Rochester, and I am also minoring in Computer Science. 
		I am very interested in how the world works, and I find both theoretical research and its application interesting.
		However, I decided to major in Mechanical Engineering because the idea of building something that could impact
		others interests me, which is why I also decided to minor in computer science. So far at UofR, 
		I have taken the following courses: CSC 170, CSC 171, CSC 172, CSC 214, and CSC 240. Additionally, 
		I have been a CHM 132 Lab Teacher Assistant, and I am currently a CSC 240/440 TA.</p>

	<h2>Work Life</h2>

	<p>During my time at the University of Rochester, I have worked at a couple of different positions. During the summers,
		I worked at Lullaby Sound Design in Louisiana, which is a company that makes hand-made, tube amplifiers for guitars 
		and violins. There I learned how to make these amplifiers and the different devices that were sold. During the 
		academic years, I have also worked on campus as a CHM 132 Lab TA, which gave me a new perspective on the experiments, 
		and I am currently a CSC 240/440 TA. Additionally, I am in the process of being hired for a student-worker position
		on campus, which I am excited for.</p>

	<h2>Free time Life</h2>
	
	<p>In my free time, I enjoy going on hikes, visiting parks, museums, and other activities. However, most of the time I
		spend outside of class and doing homework, I find myself learning things that interest me and participate in
		organizations on campus. Currently, I am learning how to play the guitar and how to build a self-balancing robot
		using arduino.</p>
